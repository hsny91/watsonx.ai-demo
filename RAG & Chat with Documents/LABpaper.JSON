        "question": "What is the most expensive part in training a Large Language Model?",
        "correct_answer": "The majority of the cost of training an LLM comes from the pre-training phase. During this phase, a model is trained in an auto-regressive manner to predict the next token in the target language using trillions of tokens worth of unlabeled data, requiring thousands of GPUs training for months at a time.",
