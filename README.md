## 🤖 What is IBM watsonx.ai?

`watsonx.ai` is IBM’s **AI studio** built for the enterprise. It enables developers, data scientists, and technical teams to **train, validate, fine-tune, deploy, and govern** both traditional machine learning models and modern **foundation models** (like IBM Granite, Llama, Mistral, etc.) — all in one secure, scalable environment.

watsonx.ai is part of the broader **watsonx platform**, which includes:

| Component         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **watsonx.ai**   | Studio for building, fine-tuning, and deploying generative AI and ML models. |
| **watsonx.data** | Open lakehouse platform optimized for analytics and AI workloads. |
| **watsonx.governance** | Tools for governing and monitoring AI with fairness, transparency, and compliance. |
